            <p>My name is Ludvig Swala and I am a recently graduated engineer from Chalmers with a strong interest in electronics, data analysis, signal processing and programming. It is my passion and drive to learn and try new things, such as creating my own website! I have worked on everything from signal classification with machine learning to sensor fusion using Kalman filters. This site is where I showcase selected projects, reflect on what I have learned, and share a bit about how I approach engineering challenges </p>

                <p><strong>NTI Kronhus:</strong> It was my time at the high school NTI that taught me the foundation of mathematics and programming that I have so much use of today. I read every math course available and read my frist 2 courses in programming that got me started on my current porgramming path.</p>
